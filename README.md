# HTML-Portfolio
A simple personal portfolio website built using HTML to showcase my profile, education, and interests. Created as part of my learning journey in web development while pursuing MSc Computer Science at PSG College of Arts and Science. It reflects my curiosity to explore and grow as a web developer.
