<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a student at PSG College of Arts and Science, currently pursuing my MSc in Computer Science. I have a strong interest in technology and a growing passion for web development. As I learn more about building and designing websites, I’m driven by curiosity to understand how everything works—from front-end design to back-end functionality. I enjoy exploring new tools, frameworks, and concepts that help me grow as a developer and expand my technical skills. My goal is to become proficient in full-stack development and contribute to creating innovative and user-friendly web solutions.</p>
